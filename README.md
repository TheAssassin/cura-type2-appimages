# DEPRECATION NOTICE

**Starting with Cura 4.2, Ultimaker will provide Type-2-AppImages out of the box. This means that this repository is now deprecated.**


# cura-type2-appimages

This tool "converts" Cura AppImages from type 1 into type 2, which is a lot more modern, more efficient and has better support in tools. The tool is run automatically on Travis CI, uploading the resulting AppImages on GitHub releases. Furthermore, update information is embedded, so users can conveniently upgrade to newer releases which have been built in this repository.

***Note:* An upstream change to type 2 is strongly preferred! Please show your support at https://github.com/Ultimaker/cura-build/issues/136!**


## Download AppImages

The AppImages build using this script on Travis CI can be found on the [release page](releases/).


## LICENSING

The contents of the AppImage are exactly the same as the ones in the [official Cura AppImages](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases), please see their page for licensing details.

This tool is MIT licensed. See [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) for more information.
